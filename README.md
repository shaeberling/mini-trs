# mini-trs
A small TRS-80 system that is self-contained and uses an embedded screen.

This is mostly based on PocketTRS, with a few changes:
 - Removes functionality to emulate a real data interface.
 - Removes emulation of PS/2 keyboard, sound and VGA.
 - Adds the ability to drive an embedded screen.
